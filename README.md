# AzureDevOpsBot
This is the public place to give feedback on the azdevops Telegram bot.
AzDevOpsBot is a Telegram bot to interact with Azure DevOps from Telegram.
This project started as a proof of concept but I realised interacting with Azure DevOps through a Telegram bot on your phone is extremely powerful.

**I'm actively looking for people that are willing to use the bot and provide feedback/come up with cool use-cases**

## Current state of the bot
Currently, the bot is capable of:
- Deliver build notifications from Azure DevOps to a Telegram chat or group

You can expect this list to grow quickly beause I'm actively working on the bot.

## Roadmap
I'm thinking of implementing the following features on the short term, but this could change depending on feedback received.
- Improve build notification message with additional information
- Request the build log for a failed build
- Send release notifications
- Deliver notifications to multiple chats instead of one
- Approve a release

## How to get access
You can only get access if you're interested to actively use the bot and provide feedback.  
Please reach out on twitter @richardrobberse or write me an email at richard@robberse-it-services.nl
Configuring the bot is dead simple and you'll be ready to use it in a few minutes.

## Provide feedback 
Please provide feedback and request new use-cases by raising an issue.

## Where's the code?
The code is currently in a private repository, I'm still thinking whether I should open-source it or not.
